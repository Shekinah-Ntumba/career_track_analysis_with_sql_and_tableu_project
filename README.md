# 🎓 Career Track Analysis with SQL and Tableau

This project analyzes learner performance and engagement within different **career learning tracks** (such as *Data Analyst*, *Data Scientist*, and *Business Analyst*). Using **SQL** for data processing and **Tableau** for visualization, it explores how quickly learners progress from enrollment to completion and how engagement patterns vary across time.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand **how long students take to complete different tracks**, **which career paths have higher completion rates**, and **how enrollment trends change throughout the year**.

Through SQL-based analysis and visualization in Tableau, the project reveals:

* Completion time distribution across career tracks
* Learner engagement levels and progress buckets (e.g., same-day vs. long-term completions)
* Monthly enrollment trends and their correlation with completion rates

The data was cleaned, joined, and transformed using SQL to calculate key metrics such as:

* Days taken to complete a track
* Whether the student completed it or not
* Categorized completion duration into defined buckets (*Same day, 1–7 days, 8–30 days, etc.*)

These insights were then visualized in **Tableau** to better understand learning behavior and identify patterns.

## 🖼️ Dashboard Explanation

The Tableau dashboard consists of **two main visualizations**:

### **1. Completion Bucket by Career Track (Left Side)**

* Displays how long students took to complete different career tracks.
* The x-axis represents **completion time buckets** — such as *Same day*, *1–7 days*, *8–30 days*, etc.
* The y-axis shows the **count of completed tracks** for each role.
* Key observation:

  * Most learners complete their tracks within **91 to 365 days**, indicating sustained engagement over a few months.
  * The **Data Analyst** and **Data Scientist** tracks show higher completion counts, suggesting strong learner interest.

### **2. Enrollment Trend and Completion Rate (Right Side)**

* The **bars** represent the number of students who enrolled in each month.
* The **line plot** shows the corresponding **completion percentage** for those enrollments.
* Key insight:

  * Enrollment spikes in **August**, possibly due to new academic or training cycles.
  * Completion rates fluctuate, suggesting opportunities to improve follow-up support and learner motivation during certain months.

## 💡 Insights & Recommendations

**Findings:**

* Most learners complete within 3–12 months, showing commitment to long-term learning.
* Enrollment and completion rates vary seasonally.
* The *Data Analyst* and *Data Scientist* tracks attract more consistent engagement than others.

**Recommendations:**

* Introduce short-term milestones to keep long-duration learners motivated.
* Increase promotional or onboarding activities during months with low enrollments.
* Offer completion incentives or mentorship during months with high enrollments to maintain performance consistency.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

* **SQL:** Data cleaning, transformation, and categorization of completion timelines.
* **Tableau:** Interactive dashboard creation and visualization of learning insights.
* **Dataset:** Career track enrollments, completion dates, and learner information.

---

## 📈 Outcome

This project provides a **data-driven understanding of learner progress**, helping institutions or platforms:

* Improve curriculum pacing and engagement strategies.
* Identify completion bottlenecks.
* Plan interventions for slower learners.
